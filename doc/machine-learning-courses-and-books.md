[Machine Learning for Developers](http://xyclade.github.io/MachineLearning/)
it covers the major aspect of machine learning, including model, learning methods, validation, evaluation with examples.

## course recommendation from quora
[quora answers](https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-new-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Foundation-course-by-Udacity-in-association-with-Siraj-Raval)

I will not suggest this course for deep learning at all.

Take courses like
- [CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/)
- [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
- [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/)
- [Oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures: Oxford Deep NLP 2017 course](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures)

and complete courses with assignment.

Take time to look at these four courses.

## Another course on Deep Reinforcement learning
machine learning has three major areas:
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

a course on the Reinforcement area from berkeley
[CS 294-112 Deep Reinforcement Learning at UC Berkeley](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

Deep neural network is applied in the area of reinforcement learning.

## neural network in unsupervised learning area
GAN (generative adversarial network) is used in unsupervised learning

can genetic algorithm be able to achieve similar generative idea?

In principle, yes, but usually an optimization algorithm that uses the n-dimensional gradient will perform much better than an optimization algorithm that uses only the 1-dimensional cost function value.
