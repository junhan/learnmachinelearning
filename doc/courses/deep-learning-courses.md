I will not suggest this course for deep learning at all.

Take courses like

- [CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/)
- [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
- [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/)
- [Oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures: Oxford Deep NLP 2017 course](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures)

and complete courses with assignment.

Take time to look at these four courses.

# Another course on Reinforcement learning
machine learning has three major areas:
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

a course on the Reinforcement area from berkeley
[CS 294-112 Deep Reinforcement Learning at UC Berkeley](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
