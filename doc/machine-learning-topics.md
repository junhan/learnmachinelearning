# tensorflow and other python libraries
The current machine learning area can be divided into two groups: deep learning (CNN, RNN, fully connected nets, linear models) vs other traditional machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forrest, KNN, naive bayes). 

The common python libraries are listed below:
- `tensorflow` is focused on the deep learning area
- `scikit-learn` can be used for the traditional algorithms, or `sklearn`
- `pandas` provides DataFrame and is optimized for data manipulation and analysis
- `pytorch` machine learning library and is used for natural language processing

Meanwhile, tensorflow supports the following traditional machine learning algorithms, according to [TensorFlow - Not Just for Deep Learning](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/2016/08/06/tensorflow-not-just-deep-learning/)
```
K-means clustering
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines
Gaussian Mixture Model clustering
Linear/logistic regression
```

# machine learning topics
Some topics on machine learning algorithms are discussed with python code implementation and comment. tensorflow will be used when possible. If not, other machine learning library will be used.

## decision tree
Soft decision tree

see [machine learning papers](machine-learning-papers.md)

# evaluation metrics
Different machine learning models can be used toward the same set of data and their performance can be evaluated with some metrics.
