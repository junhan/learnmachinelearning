# mxnet introduction 
MXNet: A Flexible and Efficient Machine Learning Library for Heterogeneous Distributed Systems

mxnet is the choice for nlp and aws builds aws comprehend based on mxnet.

[gluon nlp](https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/) is the python interface to mxnet

emory nlp team developed [ELIT](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu/elit.html), it collects some state of the art algorithms for academic use

use aws deep learning AMI with ubuntu flavor, and it installs mxnet and some other deep learning libraries

The most inexpensive option will be to use a g2.2xlarge instance at 0.65 per hour.
