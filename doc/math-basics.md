# some math basics for machine learning
Some math background knowledge is reviewed while reading through papers.

## distribution
independent random variables

gaussian distribution

## statistics

### confusion matrix for evaluation
- condition positive (P): the number of real positive cases in the data
- condition negative (N): the number of real negative cases in the data
- true positive (TP): eqv. with hit
- true negative (TN): eqv. with correct rejection
- false positive (FP): eqv. with false alarm, Type I error
- false negative (FN): eqv. with miss, Type II error

## linear regression
$y= \beta X + \epsilon$ (1)

## logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression
