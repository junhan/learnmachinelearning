# introduction
This is my work-in-progress note in the machine learning area, automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.

# environment setup and installation
- set up development environment with software and hardware: refer to [installation](doc/installation.md)
- tensorflow performance gpu vs cpu: refer to [tensorflow performance gpu vs cpu](doc/tensorflow-gpu-vs-cpu.md)

# math basics
refer to [math basics](doc/math-basics.md)

# machine learning courses notes
## deep learning specialization in coursera
[refer to course note](doc/courses/coursera/deep%20learning%20specialization/deep-learning-specialization-course-notes.md)

## machine learning in coursera
course notes are taken in jupyter notebooks.
- machine learning by Andrew Ng from coursera, refer to `python-projects/notebooks/coursera-machine-learning`

# machine learning topics
some hello-world examples using python

refer to [machine learning topics](doc/machine-learning-topics.md)

# automatic speech recognition (ASR)
Hidden markov model (HMM) was traditionally used in ASR and achieved wide acceptance. I would like to see if the recent advancement in deep learning can do a better job in ASR area, and perform some comparison with the traditional HMM approach.
